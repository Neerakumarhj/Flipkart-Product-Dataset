- Key Columns:
  - **id**: Unique product identifier  
  - **title**: Product name/description  
  - **Rating**: Average customer rating  
  - **maincateg**: Product category  
  - **platform**: Platform name (Flipkart)

##  Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates  
   - Standardized column names for easier handling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Ratings distribution  
   - Top categories by product count and ratings  
   - Price vs Rating analysis  
   - Platform comparison  
   - Reviews and star rating breakdown  

3. **Predictive Modeling (ML)**  
   - Created a proxy target: `Discount_Needed`  
   - Features: rating, reviews, price, category, platform, star distribution  
   - Model: Random Forest Classifier  
   - Achieved ~99% accuracy with good balance between precision & recall

##  Key Insights
- Most products receive **4★ and 5★ ratings**, showing generally high satisfaction.  
- Certain categories dominate in product count, but highly rated categories differ.  
- Higher prices do not always mean better ratings.  
- The ML model can predict discount-need products with high accuracy, which could help in sales strategy.
